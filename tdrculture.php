        <p class=" text-justify">The unique culture of Chitral, developed over many millennia with more
            than a dozen ethnic groups speaking as many languages, is closely linked to that of Central Asia and China
            instead of South Asia, according to a study conducted by International Union for Conservation of Nature
            (IUCN). It says that arts and crafts, traditional costumes, food and beverages, local games, music, dance,
            folksongs and legendary sites form the main components of the cultural heritage of Chitral. The study also
            includes the historic military sites and indigenous tribes (Kalash) in the ingredients of cultural heritage.

                <h4 class="">Unique Chitrali Culture</h4>
                <p class=" text-justify">“Chitral's artisans manufacture a wide range of elegant and delicately crafted
                    jewellery, woodwork and embroidery, woven and knitted textiles,” the study says, adding that clay,
                    wood, stone, bone, animal skin and copper are the material most commonly used.
                    The woolen fabric of Chitral, locally called shu , and walnut-wood furniture are popular in
                    handicraft markets throughout the country.
                    The study adds that traditional clothes, including that of Kalash people, are made from wool and
                    silk and decorated with beads and shells.
                    Traditional cap ( khapol ) and gown ( chugha ) are popular while the typical Chitrali shoes ( khon )
                    resemble the long riding boots.
                    The area's vast culinary repertoire of foods and beverages is unique in terms of both flavour and
                    presentation.
                    Regarding the local games and sports, the study says that polo and falconry are the most popular
                    recreational pursuits in Chitral while people also hunt for sport. </p>

        <p class=" text-justify">The study places music and dance at the heart of Chitrali culture. Chitral's rich and
            varied musical tradition is part of the fabric of everyday life while Chitrali sitar is famous throughout
            the world and the traditional dances, such as dani and sauz are part of the folk heritage of Central Asia.
            The folk poets of Chitral sing war songs as well as love ballades, the study says, adding that epics are
            popular among the Kalash.
            “With its origin lost in the mists of antiquity, the ancient tribe of Kalash is a unique cultural resource,”
            says the study, adding that Chilm Jusht, Uchhal, Chitirmas are some of the main festivals of the tribe that
            attract a large number of tourists to the three segregated valleys of Bumburate, Birir and Rumbur in
            Chitral.
            The study says that Chitrl is home to several preserved forts, fortresses and towers from a more recent era
            and the ruins of forts dating back to the fourth and fifty centuries BC are also found here.
            Traditional Chitrali buildings are embellished with wood carvings and have been designed keeping in view the
            climatic and local environmental conditions of the area.

    <h1 class=" text-center header-text-color">Events and Festivals</h1>
    <div class="container px-0">
        <p class="text-justify">There are various festivals which are celebrated in the district of Chitral
            which people from other parts of Pakistan have most likely never even heard about. One of such festivals is
            Jashn-e-Nowroz which is celebrated on 21st march every year. This is basically a religion festival which is
            celebrated in the memories of a Sufi saint who introduced the Ismaili faith in this region, the name of the
            Sufi Saint was Peer Nasir Khisraw. Another very famous festival held in this region is the Shandoor Polo
            festival, now everyone in Pakistan as well as around the globe is aware that Polo is played in this region
            at 10,000 feet’s above the sea level and this is not something very ordinary, ordinary people have
            breathing issues at such heights but these people not only manage to breath but play in such conditions
            which shows how strong and immune they are to these conditions. The main event and match is between the
            teams of Gilgit
            and Chitral who are arch rivals. This event is played normally during the summer because it is impossible to
            play during the harsh weather which the winter brings, so normally the event is organized in the month of
            July annually. These were the main festivals celebrated in the Chitral district however the tribes of Kalash
            have
            some of their own festivals which they celebrate which are included as follows. Chilmijhust which is
            also known asJoshi is celebrated during the spring harvest season which lasts for around 4-6 days every
            year.
            This is followed by another festival in the month of August which is called Uchal. During the month of
            December the
            festival of chitirmus which is celebrated with great joy and to pray for a better year which is
            coming.</p>

                    Ali Sher Khan Anchan who built the polo ground of Shandur as well. Shandur invites visitors
                    to experience a traditional polo tournament which since 1936 has been held annually in the
                    first week of July between the local teams of Gilgit and Chitral. Organized and financed by the
                    Tourism Corporation of NWFP, the tournament is held on Shandur Top, the highest polo ground in
                    the world at 3,700 meters (the pass itself is at 3,800 meters). The festival also includes Folk
                    music, dancing and a camping village is set up. The polo tournament is featured in the first
                    episode of Himalaya with Michael Palin.
                    Various teams of Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan have always played the game of polo closest to its
                    original form. During the early 20th century, the British in neighboring India were the patrons
                    of the game.
                    Free-styled mountain polo is arguably polo in its purest form. This version of the game played
                    at Shandur-Top has attained legendary status and is of great interest to international and
                    domestic adventure tourists alike. There are no umpires and there are no holds barred. The rules
                    are: There are no rules! In "The Roof of the World" Amin/Willets/Tetley write: "by comparison,
                    an American Wild West rodeo might pass for choir practice." As one player once mentioned: "You
                    can ride head-on into the opponent, if you dare." </p>

                    In order to decide the final teams to play at the Shandur Polo Festival, preliminary matches are
                    played both in Chitral and Gilgit, in which the best horses and players are chosen for the final
                    games by the local juries. The festival begins on 7 July. During the course of the tournament A,
                    B, C and D teams of Chitral and Gilgit. battle it out on the polo field. Each team has six
                    members with 2-4 reserve players in case of injury etc. The match duration is usually one hour.
                    It is divided into two halves, with a 10 minutes interval. During intervals, the locals enthrall
                    the audiences with traditional and cultural performances. The game decided in favour of the team
                    scoring more goals. The final is held on 9 July.
                    The field measures about 200 meters by 56 meters (normal polo field is about 270m by 150m), with
                    60 cm high stone walls running the length of the field on both sides instead of boards. As six
                    players make up one side, the field can get fairly crowded. This has the advantage of slightly
                    slowing down the pace, which, all things considered, is probably somewhat safety-enhancing.
                    Players rarely wear helmets, The horses' legs often have no bandages, and mallets often have no
                    grips or straps. </p>

                    Chitral with a history of more than 2,000 years. Raees rulers used to organize it in the remote
                    past to be continued by the Kator dynasty, which not only assiduously patronized this particular
                    cultural event, but also promoted other festivals e.g. Jashan-e- Shandur and Jashan-e-Chitral.
                    However, after the status of Chitral as an autonomous princedom came to an end in 1969, the
                    festivals of the indigenous mountain communities ceased to be celebrated until 2003 when
                    Jashan-e- Chitral for the first time was revived through the support of UNESCO after its
                    discontinuation for 27 years and Jashan-e- Qaqlasht after abandoning for 35 years.
                    In recent years, Qaqlasht festival is celebrated in the month of April. Major Events of the

                            The most important Kalash festival is the Chawmos (cawmōs, ghona chawmos yat, Khowar
                            “chitrimas” from *cāturmāsya, CDIAL 4742), which is celebrated for two weeks at winter
                            solstice (c. Dec. 7-22), at the beginning of the month chawmos mastruk. It marks the end of
                            the year’s fieldwork and harvest. It involves much music, dancing, and the sacrifice of many
                            goats. It is dedicated to the god Balimain who is believed to visit from the mythical
                            homeland of the Kalash, Tsyam (Tsiyam, tsíam), for the duration of the feast. Food
                            sacrifices are offered at the clans’ Jeshtak shrines, dedicated to the ancestors.

                            At Chaumos, impure persons are not admitted; they must be purified by a waving fire brand
                            over women and children and by a special fire ritual for men, involving a shaman waving
                            juniper brands over the men. The ‘old rules’ of the gods (Devalog, dewalōk) are no longer in
                            force, as is typical for year-end and carnival-like rituals. The main Chaumos ritual takes
                            place at a Tok tree, a place called Indra’s place, “indrunkot”. Indrunkot is sometimes
                            believed to belong to Balumain’s brother, In(dr), lord of cattle. Ancestors, impersonated by
                            young boys (ōnjeṣṭa ‘pure’) are worshipped and offered bread; they hold on to each other and
                            form a chain and snake through the village. </p>

                    and continues to be a culturally bonding force. Although the Nauruz tradition goes back to ancient
                    Persia, the
                    largest volume of literature that is inspired by it belongs to the Muslim era. Nauruz is a
                    celebration
                    of the unfolding of beauty in the natural world, expression of gratitude for its many gifts, and
                    also
                    for the blessings of freedom and human dignity. Different games are played by the youth-folk

                    friends. The first day of the year in the local calendar is also reckoned from this day and the
                    elders
