                <p class="text-dark text-justify">The history of Chitral dates back to ancient times, with evidence of
                    human habitation in the region dating back to the Stone Age. Over the centuries, the region was
                    inhabited by different ethnic groups, including the Kho people, who are believed to be the earliest
                    inhabitants of the area.

                    In the 4th century BC, the region was conquered by Alexander the Great, who established several
                    settlements in the area. After Alexander's death, the region fell under the rule of various empires
                    and dynasties, including the Mauryan Empire, the Kushan Empire, and the Hindu Shahi dynasty.

                    In the 7th century AD, Chitral became a part of the Islamic caliphate and remained under Muslim rule
                    until the 16th century, when it was conquered by the powerful Kho tribe. The Kho ruled over Chitral
                    for several centuries until the 19th century, when the region was annexed by the British Empire.
                    <br><br>
                    Under British rule, Chitral was established as a separate princely state and remained so until the
                    partition of India in 1947, when it became a part of Pakistan. Since then, Chitral has been a part
                    of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

                    Throughout its history, Chitral has been a center of trade and commerce, with its strategic location
                    on the Silk Road connecting Central Asia with South Asia. The region has also been renowned for its
                    rich cultural heritage, with influences from different civilizations and cultures over the
                    centuries. Today, Chitral remains a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors from all over
                    the world to experience its unique history, culture, and natural beauty.

                <p class="text-dark text-justify">Chitral is a mountainous district located in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
                    province of Pakistan, bordered by Afghanistan to the north and west, Gilgit-Baltistan to the east,
                    and Swat and Upper Dir districts to the south. The region is known for its rugged terrain, with the
                    towering peaks of the Hindu Kush mountain range dominating the landscape.

                    The district is spread over an area of 14,850 square kilometers, with an estimated population of
                    around 500,000 people. The main town and administrative center of the district is Chitral Town,
                    which is located in the western part of the district.

                    The terrain of Chitral is varied, with elevations ranging from 1,094 meters above sea level in the
                    Lowari Top area to over 7,000 meters at the Tirich Mir mountain, the highest peak in the region. The
                    district is also home to several rivers, including the Chitral River, which flows through the center
                    of the district, and the Kunar River, which forms the northern border with Afghanistan.

                    The region is known for its breathtaking natural beauty, with numerous valleys, lakes, glaciers, and
                    waterfalls dotting the landscape. Some of the notable attractions in the area include the Shandur
                    Pass, the Chitral Gol National Park, the Kalash Valley, and the Bumburet Valley.

                    Due to its rugged terrain and remote location, Chitral remains largely inaccessible by road, with
                    most of the area's transport carried out by air or on foot. The region's economy is largely
                    dependent on agriculture, with farming and livestock rearing being the primary occupations of the
                    local population. The district is also known for its traditional handicrafts, including embroidery,
                    woodworking, and weaving.

                <p class="text-justify text-dark">Chitral is a remote district in northern Pakistan, and accessing it
                    can be challenging due to its rugged terrain and limited infrastructure. Here are some of the ways
                    to access Chitral:
                <ul style="list-style:decimal;" class="ml-5">


                    <li>By Air: The easiest way to access Chitral is by air. There are twice a week flights from
                        Islamabad to
                        Chitral operated by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). The flight takes about an hour and
                        offers
                        stunning aerial views of the mountainous landscape. It's important to book your flights in
                        advance
                        as they can get booked quickly, especially during peak travel seasons.</li>

                    <li>By Road: Chitral is connected to the rest of Pakistan by a single road, the Lowari Pass road.
                        The
                        road is often closed during the winter months due to heavy snowfall, making it inaccessible.
                        However, during the summer months, it's possible to access Chitral by road via the Lowari Pass.
                        The
                        journey takes about 10-12 hours from Islamabad and can be quite challenging due to the steep and
                        winding roads.</li>

                    <li>By Trekking: For adventure enthusiasts, trekking is a popular way to access Chitral. There are
                        several trekking routes that lead to Chitral, including the Shandur Pass trek and the Chitral
                        Gol
                        trek. Trekking offers a unique opportunity to explore the rugged terrain and remote villages of
                        the
                        region. However, trekking requires a high level of fitness and preparation, and it's important
                        to
                        hire a local guide for safety.</li>
                </ul>
                Overall, accessing Chitral requires careful planning and preparation, especially if you're traveling
                during the winter months. It's important to check the weather and road conditions before traveling
                and to book your flights and accommodations in advance.</p>

                    this
                    difference is forgotten in the unity and affection that binds them to each other. The various
                    tribes
                    of Chitral are as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-justify"><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:15pt; color:#296388;">Khow: </span>In

                    eleventh
                    century, the Kalash ruled over Lower Chitral, up till Hurbuns. In 1220, the tribe of Khow
                    defeated
                    Bal Singh, the
                    Kalash ruler, and pushed them to the south western valleys of Chitral. Living with the Khow,
                    they
                    gradually embraced Islam. But those in the valleys of Bomborate, Birir and Rumbur clung to their
                    own
                    religion and culture. Until the 1970s, not much was known about this tribe that resided in the
                    south
                    west of Chitral, in
                    the three valleys of Bomborate, Birir and Rumbur. This pagan tribe of 3,000 people follows its
                    own
                    distinct culture and traditions. Their origin is still not known. Either their original home is
                    Syria or Tsiyam, the old name of Thailand. From here, they migrated to Afghanistan and then to
                    Pakistan. The Kalash are illiterate but clever people, and excel as masons and craftsmen. They
                    have
                    a friendly temperament and are fond of music and dancing. Their native language is Kalasha or
                    Kalashamun.</p>

                    92%
                    of the population of Chitral and are spread in many villages. Original khow are
                    of Aryan ancestry. It is believed that they came from central Asia, Afghanistan and Kashmir.
                    This
                    dominant ethnic group is a heterogeneous tribe with an age-old class system. Basically, they are
                    happy and contented people fond of music and hunting. Women observe pardah and are expert in
                    making

                    and
                    Ambore in the south west. In the last decade of the nineteenth century, they came from Noristan
                    (Afghanistan), their homeland, due to Ameer Abdur Rehman Khan's forced conversions to Islam. In
                    1926, they embraced Islam. In their families, women work while men love gossip and sports. Their
                    favorite pastime is to play with snow in winters. There was a time when they were known for
                    their

                    areas
                    of Chitral that border Afghanistan while others have placed them in Broghail Valley in the east

                    Chitral. Their living depends on agriculture and livestock.

                    These came from Tajikistan and Badakhshan in 1700 AD and settled in Madaklasht village of Shishi
                    Kuh
                    valley. Their ancestor made weapons from iron and the ruler of Chitral invited them for this
                    purpose. The speak Khowar and Persian and follow the customs and habits of the Khow people.
                    However,
                    some of their culture is still preserved and Daree, their language, is still spoken in
                    Madaklasht.
                    Thus, they have preserved their individuality while mixing with the Khow society.

                    This is a nomad
                    tribe
                    that came from Dir, Swat, Hazara, Kohistan and Afghanistan during Katur rule
                    and settled in the southern valleys of Chitral. Their population is concentrated in Shishi Koh
                    and
                    also in the valleys of Arundu (or Arnadu) or Domail. They are herdsmen distinguished by their
                    migratory temperament; in spring, they move from the south to the north eastern valleys (the
                    upper
                    areas) in search of pastures while in winter, they descend to warmer areas at lower heights. And
                    because they are nomads, there is no discipline amongst them. Today, however, they are giving up
                    herding in favor of a settled life of trade and farming. The slyness and cleverness of the
                    Gujars

                    about
                    20 miles north of Arundu/Arnadu. They are divided into two groups; Shintari and Sawatis or
                    Afghanis.
                    The Shintari claim that they are the originals or ancient inhabitants of the area. The latter
                    separated themselves from Arandvi Afghans and came here around 1400 AD. They speak Damia, a
                    language
                    that is related to Khowar and Gowarbati.
